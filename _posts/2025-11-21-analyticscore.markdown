This work develops a principled approach towards developing interpretable automated scoring solutions for large-scale educational assessments. Bases on the analysis of stakeholder needs and potential benefits, we formalize four principles for interpretable automated scoring: Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI). As a reference framework illustrating the feasibility of implementing these principles we introduce <b>AnalyticScore</b> in the domain of short-answer scoring. AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, achieves competitive scoring accuracy compared to the uninterpretable SOTA, and demonstrates featurization behaviors that align with human judgment.
