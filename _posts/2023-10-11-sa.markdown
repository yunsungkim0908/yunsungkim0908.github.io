<i>StochasticGrade</i> is an open-source framework for auto-grading programs that produce probabilistic output. It offers an exponential speedup over the standard two-sample hypothesis testing baseline on identifying incorrect programs and allows the rate of misgrades to be adjusted. Moreover, the "disparity measurements" calculated by StochasticGrade can be used for fast and accurate clustering of student programs by error type. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of StochasticGrade using student data collected from 4 assignments in an introductory programming course.
