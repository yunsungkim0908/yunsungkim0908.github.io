Are there structures underlying student work that are universal across every open-ended task? We demonstrate that, across many subjects and assignment types, the probability distribution underlying student-generated open-ended work is close to Zipfâ€™s Law. We discuss how inferring this latent structure can help classrooms and develop an inference algorithm.
