High-Resolution Course Feedback (HRCF) is a tool for minimizing the delay between when an issue comes up in a course and when the instructors get feedback about it. It requests feedback from a small random subset of the students each week, but surveys each student exactly twice per term. We demonstrate that without extra effort compared to mid/end-of-term surveys, HRCF can provide constructive and actionable feedback early on.
